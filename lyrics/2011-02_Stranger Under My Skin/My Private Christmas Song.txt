Well this Christmas,
I am falling like snowflakes at your door
As my guardian angel singing for someone else
Eternity stings, when love has turned into pain
Woo 'love' must be something I don't deserve
This is my private Christmas Song

All the memories are fading Snow turns to rain
As tonight, I am craving for those endless kisses
A melody written for someone
just as a child has its parents

This song is something you never care for
Well This is My Private Christmas song
This is My Private Christmas Song
