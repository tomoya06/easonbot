Because you're good to me

作词：陈奂仁/黄振轩
作曲：陈奂仁
编曲：陈奂仁

Because you're good to me babe, I know
That you're up to something　And I don't like it

Because you're good to me babe, I know
You're no good　It's no good　To be in love with you again

当时分手之后　多么心痛
你却还能够说　都是我的错
之后你打电话　说你很寂寞
一直想念我　是否还能够做个朋友

(No baby　No baby)　请你别再靠近我
(No baby　No baby)　你没那么的保守
(No baby　No baby)　别到现在才来对我说
你后悔了　And ask me for more

Because you're good to me babe, I know
That you're up to something　And I don't like it

Because you're good to me babe, I know
You're no good　It's no good
To be in love with you again

昨晚跟好朋友　开个 Party
怎么都没想到　会再见到你
你的甜言蜜语　让我佩服到底
谁在谁怀里　爱谁不过是个骗局
