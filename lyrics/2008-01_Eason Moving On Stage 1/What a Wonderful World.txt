What a Wonderful World

作曲：George David Weiss/Bob Thiele

I see trees are green, red roses, too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow

So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying 'how do you do?'
They're really saying I love you

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They learn much more
Than I'll never know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
