Paging all my people who are hurt
In the desert of their lies
We won't take this from them anymore
We're not astray
We're not ashamed

Come on down my friend from here
There's a chance, I know, of rain

Wash those tears you have inside
It's a fear, it will subside
You should try, you should try
Change it any way you can
Rhyme it like the Muffin Man
You should try, you should try

#You don't need to hide it anymore
It's OK, you can feel
I don't have to tell you who you are

You're a star, you're a star

Come on down my friend, I know
This is life, and we've got to go#


*Wash those tears you have inside
It's a fear, it will subside
You should try, you should try
Change it any way you can
Rhyme it like the Muffin Man
You should try, you should try*

Repeat #**

Every time I see your face
You look at me with foolish eyes
Everybody hold your horses
Don't believe in what they say
Everyone is here tonight
So you should try
