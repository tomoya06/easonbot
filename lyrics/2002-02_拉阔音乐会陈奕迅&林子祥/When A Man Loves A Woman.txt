When a Man Loves a Woman

When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she's bad he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman,
Spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all of his comfort
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I will give everything I've got

Tryin' to hold on to her precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can't ever see

If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman.....
