Aren't You Glad

Aren't you glad you didn't stay with me,
Bohemian life and instability.
You went off to university.
And you took your love away from me.

Endless nights, lovers friends and fun,
Big-City lights, your new life had begun.

And as the world turns on and on,
Love is lost and love is won,
laughed and cried when we were young.
You went your own way, I survived.
And did you ever see everything inside of me?

So now you live your life in luxury,
double glazing, turbo washing machine.
And your fiance is boring as hell,
You never laugh, you're both professionl.

You know that film, that I'd started to write?
It's a box-office smash and I'm on the next flight
to get my award on TV tonight,

Looking back, I think I've done alright.

And as the world turns on and on,
love is lost and love is won,
laughed and cried when we were young.
You went your own way, I survived.
And did you ever see everything inside of me?

And as the world turns on and on,
love is lost and love is won,
laughed and cried when we were young.
You went your own way, I survived
And did you ever see everything inside of me?

Oh, aren't you glad you didn't stay.
Oh, aren't you glad you didn't stay with me?
Oh, aren't you glad you didn't stay with me?

You didn't want my love.
So aren't you glad, aren't you glad, aren't you glad.
Aren't you glad, aren't you glad.
Aren't you glad, aren't you glad.
